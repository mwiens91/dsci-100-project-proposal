The response variable we will predict is the `subscribe` variable from the `players` dataframe. Candidate predictor features are the `experience`, `played_hours`, `gender`, and `age` variables, all from the `players` dataframe. We can also derive additional predictor features from the `sessions` dataframe, such as:\n",
