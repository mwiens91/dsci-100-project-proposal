The general idea of what we need to do is to find features—either the variables themselves or transformations of them—which help us predict player newsletter subscription status. This is a binary classification problem and we will focus on maximizing the accuracy of whichever model we choose, with recall and precision as secondary considerations (since we don't know the motivation behind Frank Wood's question, it's not clear which we should prioritize)."

    "The only classification algorithm we've learned in class is $k$-nearest neighbors (KNN), which we'll use here. The response variable we will predict is the `subscribe` variable from the `players` dataframe. Candidate predictor features are the `experience`, `played_hours`, `gender`, and `age` variables, also all from the `players` dataframe. We can also derive additional predictor features from the `sessions` dataframe, such as:\n",
    "+ number of sessions\n",
    "+ average session length\n",
    "+ average time of day played\n",
